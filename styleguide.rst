Headers
~~~~~~~

RST does not have strict requirements on header heirarchy, but keeping a
consistent heirarchy makes thing easier to read. In our docs, our
titles and H1 are surrounded by =, H2 underlined by ~, H3 underlined by -, H4
underlined by ^, H5 underlined by \*, and H6 underlined by " example:

.. code::

    =================
    Title or Header 1
    =================

    Header 2
    ~~~~~~~~

    Header 3
    --------

    Header 4
    ^^^^^^^^

    Header 5
    ********

    Header 6
    """"""""

which looks like

=================
Title or Header 1
=================

Header 2
~~~~~~~~

Header 3
--------

Header 4
^^^^^^^^

Header 5
********

Header 6
""""""""

Tables
~~~~~~

RST allows for several different ways of creating tables, the easiest way is
the following although it is not extremely flexable

.. code::

    ======== ========
    Column 1 Column 2
    ======== ========
     Data 1   Data 2
     Data 3   Data 4
    ======== ========

which looks like:

======== ========
Column 1 Column 2
======== ========
 Data 1   Data 2
 Data 3   Data 4
======== ========

The second way is harder to manage, but more flexible

.. code::

    +----------+----------+----------+
    | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
    +==========+==========+==========+
    | Data 1   | Data 2   | Data 3   |
    +----------+----------+----------+
    | Data 4   |       Data 5        |
    +----------+---------------------+


Which ends up looking like

+----------+----------+----------+
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
+==========+==========+==========+
| Data 1   | Data 2   | Data 3   |
+----------+----------+----------+
| Data 4   |       Data 5        |
+----------+---------------------+

The final way is easiest to manage but hardest to visualize before built to
html

.. code::

    .. csv-table:: Table Title
       :header: "Column 1", "Column 2"
       :widths: 20, 40

       "Data 1", "Data 2"
       "Data 3", "Data 4"

Which looks like:

.. csv-table:: Table Title
   :header: "Column 1", "Column 2"
   :widths: 20, 40

   "Data 1", "Data 2"
   "Data 3", "Data 4"

Code Blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~

It is common to need to include code in tutorials. Our docs are built with
sphinx, which allows you to include code by using the following:

.. code::

    .. code::

        code goes here

Which looks like:

.. code::

    code goes here

Lists
~~~~~

Ordered lists should be done like the following

.. code::

    #. Item 1

        #. Item 1a

    #. Item 2

        #. Item 2a

    #. Item 3

        #. Item 3a

and unordered lists should be done with "*", such as:

.. code::

    * List Item

    * List Item

    * List Item

Images
~~~~~~

Images are useful, but not required in our documentation. If you want to have
an image in an article, put the image in the ./images directory relative to the
article and reference it from there, using the following

.. code::

    .. figure:: images/image.png

Bold and Italicized Text
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bold and italicized text are allowed in our documentation to emphasize key
words or points, they can be done by surrounding a word with * or **
